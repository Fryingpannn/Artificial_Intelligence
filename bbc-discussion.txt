a) According to the bar chart in step 2, the classes in this dataset seem almost equally represented and they are equally important, so accuracy is a good measure for the success of this model.
b) The two tries of Naive Bayes training with default smoothing value (=1) produce the exact same result. This is expected because there is no random factor in this Naive Bayes model. Accuracy seems slightly more in the model with the smoothing value of 0.0001 (%97.3) than the other 3 models. This is the smallest smoothing value between all 4 experiements and based on the size of the dataset, a smaller value is more appropriate and smoothing will have less side effects. The model with smoothing value of 0.9 is almost identical to the model with smoothing value of 1 in terms of accuracy since the change in smoothing value is very small between the models.
