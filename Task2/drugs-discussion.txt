The naive-bayes, perceptron, multi-layered perceptron and decision trees's accuracy and F1 scores did not change. This is expected because none of the parameters, nor the random state or the data have been changed during each iteration. Thus, the results for the same model does not change. 

For the top decision tree and top multi-layered perceptron with grid search, the results for their accuracies and F1 scores did not change, however, they are expected to change. This is because with grid search, multiple parameters are introduced and the model picks the best one
